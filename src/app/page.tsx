                  Fresh out of college in an unrelated field, I found myself
                  questioning where my true passion lay. Despite having a
                  background in an entirely different field, my fascination with
                  computers and video game consoles persisted, leaving me
                  wondering about the inner workings of the systems that brought
                  me so much joy. Driven by curiosity and a desire for
                  fulfillment, I joined an introductory computer science course,
                  Concepts of Programming.{' '}
                  <span className="italic">Everything clicked.</span> The joy
                  and excitement I experienced while learning about programming
                  were unlike anything I had felt before. It was in that moment
                  that I knew I had found my true passion. Since then, I've
                  graduated with a degree in computer science and have immersed
                  myself in the world of software development, constantly
                  learning and growing along the way.
